# deep_learning_framework
This repository contains a personal implementation of deep learning algorithm such as multi layer perceptron, CNN, RNN etc. The idea came after finishing the Deep Learning Specialisation, provide by DeepLearning.ia on Coursera, to fully understand the mathematics and the workflow in deep learning
